# Data VR
Data Visualization has transformed the way we work with data. Technologies like Data Science and Machine Learning have changed our perspective over data analytics. We wanted to take it to the next step by building an immersive VR experience of visualizing data for Los Angeles County. We built it on Unity and Oculus Rift. We faced a lot of challenges starting from configuration problems in the Oculus Rift software and lots of Unity crashes. These issues were mostly technical and hindered our workflow at times. With the Oculus, our primary issue involved connection and calibration of the actual device with its sensors. For Unity, we had problems with its "Collaboration" functionality and spent hours trying to find workarounds to work on the same project. We divided the county into ten primary regions and collected real-time data like property values, air quality, and crime rates from the Open Data API. To visualize this, we created a virtual environment with all the data represented in a map of LA county that the user is free to explore with the aid of Oculus Rift. Real Time data visualization has a huge scope in many industries specializes in complex data analytics. Our project focused on a limited number of sectors like Real estate, Air pollution, Homelessness, Crime rates, and Public Transit usage. Our vision is to incorporate real-time data from more sectors such as Traffic, Health Care, Education rates, Income distribution, etc.
